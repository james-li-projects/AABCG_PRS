Code developed for the project "Improved Polygenic Risk Score Prediction of Breast Cancer Risk in Women of African Ancestry Leveraging Information Across Ancestries, Subtypes, and Methods"

The following two master files detail the processing of genetic data from the African American Breast Cancer Genetics Consortium (AABCG) and subsequent PRS development:
1) master_AABCG_PROCESSING.Rmd is the markdown file detailing all of the steps taken to process and harmonize AABCG data across different genotyping platforms in preparation for PRS development. 
2) master_PRS_AABCG.Rmd is the markdown file detailing all of the steps taken to develop PRS models of BC in women of African ancestry.

Note: These two markdown files directly reference the Rscripts and shell scripts that are called for each step, which have also been uploaded to this GitHub page.
