The following two master files detail genetic data processing and PRS development:
1) master_AABCG_PROCESSING.Rmd is the markdown file detailing all of the steps taken to process and harmonize AABCG data across different genotyping platforms in preparation for PRS development. 
2) master_PRS_AABCG.Rmd is the markdown file detailing all of the steps taken to develop PRS models of BC in women of African ancestry.

Note: These two markdown files directly reference the Rscripts and shell scripts that are called for each step, which have also been uploaded to this GitHub page.
